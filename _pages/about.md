Welcome to my website! I'm thrilled to have you here! ðŸ˜Š

I am a Senior Lecturer at the Lee Shau Kee School of Business and Administration, Hong Kong Metropolitan University, specializing in tourism and hospitality management. Prior to joining HKMU, I earned my PhD in Business Administration from the Fox School of Business at Temple University.

My research interests include customer experience, digitalization, and trauma in business contexts. I have participated in various academic and professional research projects, such as the Philadelphia International Airport Passenger Survey Project and the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) internships. I have also acquired multiple research skills, such as netnography, experimental methods, statistical causal inference, meta-analysis, causal trees, and structural equation modeling. 

I teach courses on designing tourism experiences, digital portfolio creation, event management, and introduction to tourism management.

I am motivated by the goal of advancing the knowledge and practice of business through data-driven insights and solutions.
