Welcome to my website! I'm thrilled to have you here! ðŸ˜Š

I am a Ph.D. candidate (ABD) in Business Administration at Fox School of Business at Temple University, specializing in tourism and hospitality. I am also a teaching and research assistant, instructing courses on designing tourism experiences and digital portfolio creation, and supporting faculty and students with data analysis and research methods.

My research interests include customer experience, digitalization, and trauma in business contexts. I have participated in various academic and professional research projects, such as the Philadelphia International Airport Passenger Survey Project and the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) internships. I have also acquired multiple research skills, such as netnography, experimental methods, statistical causal inference, meta-analysis, causal trees, and structural equation modeling. 

I am motivated by the goal of advancing the knowledge and practice of tourism and hospitality and general business through data-driven insights and solutions.
